Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the creation and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
It plays a vital role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software application and system that solves human challenges.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming language (C)
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: It is the act of gathering and documenting the customer needs and system requirements.
2. Design: This is the act of creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: It is the act of writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: It is the act of testing the software to ensure it meets the highh-quality standards and functional requirement
5. Deployment: It is the act of releasing or delivering the software to the customer.
6. Maintenance: This is the act of providing ongoing support, changeing of features or upgrade to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology focuses on the sequential approach while Agile methodology focuses on iterative and incremental approach.
Waterfall can be used in the aspect of (requirement, design and implementation) while Agile can be used in the aspect of (testing and maintenance).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. The role of a Software Developer is to write code and implement software solutions.
2. The role of a Quality Assurance Engineer is to ensure the quality of a software by designing and executing test plans.
3. The role of a Project Manager is to oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The importance of IDEs is that it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g (Visual Studio Code). And the importance of VCS is that it is a tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g (GIT).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements and Tight deadlines
startegies to overcoming challenges include: effective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit: It is the act of testing individual components or modules of software
2. Integration: It is the act of testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System: This is the act of testing the enitre software system
4. Acceptance: It is the act of testing the software against user requirements to ensure it mmets user needs. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions, statements or instructions to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
